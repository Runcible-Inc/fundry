## Investment Thesis (2025)

### "Service as Software"
Madrona's core thesis: AI agents that deliver **outcomes**, not just tools. The market for AI targeting labor directly is tens of trillions vs $900B enterprise software.

### Key focus areas:
1. **Applied AI / Intelligent Applications** — not pure infrastructure
2. **AI agents at the edge** — on-device, air-gapped (EdgeRunner investment)
3. **Outcome-based pricing models** — charging for results, not seats
4. **"Reasoning machines"** — AI that improves through integration and feedback
5. **Dual wedge strategy** — products serving both experts and novices

### What they look for in founders:
- Scrappiness
- Genuine curiosity
- Humility
- Domain expertise
- Customer empathy

## The Meeting: What to Prepare

### 1. Pitch Deck (Madrona Seed Guide format)

Essential slides:
1. **Who you are + one-liner** — clarity over graphics
2. **Problem** — high-priority pain, customer empathy
3. **Solution** — how it works, demo if possible
4. **Why now** — market timing, AI capability inflection
5. **Market size** — TAM/SAM/SOM
6. **Business model** — outcome-based pricing resonates
7. **Traction** — users, revenue, pilots
8. **Team** — domain expertise, scrappiness
9. **Ask** — amount, use of funds

### 2. Narrative alignment

Position Runcible against their thesis:
- **"Service as Software"** — Does Runcible deliver outcomes, not just tools?
- **"Reasoning machines"** — Does it improve through feedback loops?
- **Dual wedge** — Can it serve both power users and novices?

### 3. Seattle angle

- Curt visiting in person is a major plus
- Madrona is relationship-heavy and Seattle-loyal
- Reference their IA40 list if relevant comparisons exist

### 4. Data room prep

Have ready:
- Cap table
- Historical P&L / burn rate
- Product demo access
- Technical architecture overview
- Customer references (if any)
