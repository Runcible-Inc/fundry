## Investment Thesis (2025-2026)

### Core beliefs:
1. **Reasoning models** are the future — shift from pattern recognition to multi-step problem-solving
2. **Agentic coworkers** — AI that manages end-to-end workflows autonomously
3. **Unstructured data** is the next big problem — platforms that clean, structure, govern multimodal data
4. **"Thinking tools"** over "making tools" — exploration > execution
5. **Service functions automation** — HR, finance, legal ripe for AI disruption

### What they're watching:
- Computer use agents (OpenAI Agent, Project Mariner)
- AI-native applications vs AI wrappers
- Vertical-specific AI agents
- Open source AI infrastructure
